# convolutional-neural-mnist
tensorflow x python3 x cnn

Used Tensorflow with guidance to create an mnist model off a number data set (https://pjreddie.com/media/files/mnist_train.csv ).

The model created after 30 minutes of iteration (around 8000 iterations) is 98% accurate in classifying numbers.
